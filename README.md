# Wrek's Diner

A project that started off focused on learning JavaScript, but sort of turned into a blank canvas for tinkering with Bootstrap, PHP, & SQL. This was reworked to fit under Udacity's "Landing Page" project guidelines for their JS section with the extra elements removed, but was merged back into the original project once finished.
